The purpose of this script is to provide a convenient and efficient way to hook into PyTorch model layers during the forward pass(backward is coming), allowing you to capture or modify the inputs and outputs of specified layers. 


Inspired by the nethook.py [here](https://github.com/kmeng01/rome/blob/main/util/nethook.py), but DeepHook is much simpler and easier to understand. 

# how does this work?

Sure, let's provide a more detailed description of the script:

1. **`Trace` Class**: This class acts as a hook into a specific layer of a PyTorch model during a forward pass. Upon initialization, it takes in a model, the layer name, and optional settings (whether to retain input and output, and an optional function to modify the output). 

    The class registers a forward hook on the specified layer. When the layer is called during a forward pass, the hook captures the input and output of the layer. If specified, it also modifies the output using the provided `edit_output` function.

    If `retain_input` is `True`, the hook stores the input to the layer in `self.input`. If `retain_output` is `True`, it stores the output (potentially modified by `edit_output`) in `self.output`.

    The `Trace` class is a context manager, meaning it can be used in a `with` statement. When the `with` block is entered, the `__enter__` method is called, which simply returns `self`. When the `with` block is exited, the `__exit__` method is called, which removes the registered hook, ensuring no leftover hooks remain attached to the model.

2. **`TraceMultiple` Class**: This class is a context manager for hooking into multiple layers of a PyTorch model simultaneously. It accepts a model and a dictionary mapping layer names to a tuple of settings (whether to retain output and input, an optional function to modify the output).

    The `TraceMultiple` class creates a `Trace` object for each layer and manages them using an `ExitStack` from the `contextlib` module. This ensures that all hooks are properly removed when the `with` block is exited, even if an error occurs during the forward pass.

    Like `Trace`, `TraceMultiple` is a context manager, so it can be used in a `with` statement. The `__enter__` method enters the `ExitStack` context and also enters the context of each `Trace` object (i.e., registers all the hooks). The `__exit__` method ensures all `Trace` contexts are exited (i.e., all hooks are removed), and then exits the `ExitStack` context.

Here's a usage example:

```python
def edit_fn(output):
    return output + 1  # a simple function that adds 1 to the output

layer_settings = {
    'transformer.wpe': (True, False, None),  # retain output, don't retain input, no edit function
    'transformer.h.0': (True, True, edit_fn),  # retain output and input, use edit_fn to edit output
    # Add more layers as needed...
}

with TraceMultiple(model, layer_settings) as tm:
    _ = model(**encoded_input)

# Access the input and output of each hooked layer
wpe_output = tm['transformer.wpe'].output
h0_input = tm['transformer.h.0'].input
h0_output = tm['transformer.h.0'].output
```
